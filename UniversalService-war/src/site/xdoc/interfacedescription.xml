	        <p>
	            
	            Since the UniversalService is a SOAP webservice, the interface is described in form of 
	            a WSDL File. In general, the service provides methods that can be called by its clients. 
	            Each method has input paramters of a specific type and expected outcome parameters. 
	            Including that type of information in the interface description ensures that each client
	            using the service exactly knows what can be expected from the webmethod calls. 
	            <br/>
	            <br/>
	            As of now, two webmethods are supported: 
	        </p>
	        <ol>
	            <li><b>addBooks: </b> Method enabling clients to transmit books to the service. Those books
	                are then persisted in the datastore.</li>
	            <li><b>getBooksByTag: </b>Method that gives users the possibility to search for books in the
	                datastore based on specified tags. If books, that possess those tags, are found by the service, 
	                these items are returned to the client.</li>
	        </ol>
