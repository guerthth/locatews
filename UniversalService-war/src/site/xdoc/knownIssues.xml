			<subsection name="Application only works locally">
				<ol>
					<li>
						Everytime new feature should be tested in the local environment.
						In order to do so, the devserver
						comes with the appengine maven
						plugin is used. Starting the server in
						the commandline with the
						command
						<b>mvn appengine:devserver</b>
						starts the server which can then be accessed in the web browser of
						choice
						by invoking
						<i>http://localhost:8080</i>
						. Since we are testing a webservice,
						<i>http://localhost:8080/BookServiceService</i>
						has to be called using SoapUI
						(
						<a href="http://soapui.org/">SoapUI homepage</a>
						). A more detailled description on how the webservice can
						be
						debugged on the devserver can the found in the
						<a href="#serviceDebugging"></a>
						.
					</li>
					<li>
						Even if the service works on the devserver, it is not guaranteed
						that it also works after uploading
						it to google app engine using
						<b>mvn appengine:update</b>
						. Therefore, it is important to test the functionality
						immediately
						after uploading a new version of the service. If the requests to
						<i>https://theuniversalwebservice.appspot.com/BookServiceService
						</i>
						are not working anymore, the following
						steps can be undertaken:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Remove all installed maven jars in the .m2 folder. This can
								solve the issue of interfering
								dependencies. After removing the
								content on the folder, rerun
								<i>mvn clean install</i>
								which
								triggers the new installation of only needed dependencies.
							</li>
							<li>
								If no further steps help, check the versions of the service on
								<a href="https://appengine.google.com/">https://appengine.google.com/</a>
								. Set another version as default
								and delete the old version.
								After that rerun
								<i>mvn clean install</i>
								.

			<subsection name="Debugging the webservice on devserver"
				id="serviceDebugging">
				<p>
					As mentioned in the prvious sections, the functionality of the
					webservice can be tested locally by using
					the devserver which is
					started with the mvn command
					<i>mvn appengine:devserver</i>
					. Besides invoking that
					command from the commandline, one can also
					import the project in an IDE
					(e.g. eclise) and start the server
					from
					the UI.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a maven project is imported to eclipse, it is also possible to
					debug the GAE SOAP webservice quite easily.
					However, there are some
					configurations that have to be done in eclipse
					before being able to
					do so. Details
					on that can be found
					<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/maven">here</a>
					and
					<a
						href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13924990/how-do-i-make-eclipse-and-mvn-appenginedevserver-talk-to-each-other">here</a>
					.
					The neccessary steps are summarized in the following.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Setup / import the maven GAE project.
					</li>
					<li>
						Setup one debug configuration in eclipse that runs the
						<i>appengine:devserver</i>
						maven target.
					</li>
					<li>
						Setup a second debug configuration that will connect the debug
						client to the devserver jvm. This
						debug configuration is a
						<i>Remote Java Application</i>
						configuration.
					</li>
					<li>
						In order to make debugging work, some jvm args have to be
						passed to
						the maven goal. This can be achieved by adding the
						follwing in the
						pom File. <!-- POM section for GAE webservice debugging -->
						<img alt="Debugging_GAE_Webservice" src="images/debugging_pomsection.png"
							width="80%" />
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>After those steps have been taken, run the maven debug
					configuration, then run the debug client configuration, and then
					exercise the application. This can be done by using e.g. SOAP-UI
					and sending requests to the locally runnung webservice. The used
					port has to be the same as defined in the pom file.

			<subsection name="Concurrent modifications on collections"
				id="concurrentCollectionModification">
				<p>
					When iterating over collections (e.g. Set, ArrayList,..) it
					sometimes happens that a ConcurrentModificationException occurs.
					In
					order to overcome that issue, one has to make the collection
					syncronized.
					This can be done by using for example the
					Collections.synchronizedSet
					method and pass it the Set that should
					be synchronized.
					Besides that, when iterating over the collection,
					this access should be done using a synchronized blocl that locks
					the collection object. See also
					<a
						href="http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/lessons/how-do-i-synchronize-a-list-or-other-collection-in-java.html">this</a>
					link for further details.

				name="Unit Testing datastore transactions including entity relationships"
				id="datastoreunittesting">
				<p>
					Entities can be stored to the Google data store using ORMs like
					JPA or JDO.
					The possibility for unit testing data store transactions
					is a huge
					advantage of datanucleus.
					Doing so enables us to test all
					our database transactions without the
					need to use productive
					database.
					In order to do so, the LocalServiceTestHelper can be used.
					More specifically this LocalServiceTestHelper has to be created
					with AlternateHighRepJobPolicy in order to make unit tests work.
					The implementation can be found in the top level class of the
					persistence unit test which is JPATest.java.
